              enter without submitting feedback, please speak to the General
              Manager of the store location. Submission constitutes your
              unconditional acceptance to these Official Rules. Once you have
              submitted your feedback you will receive one (1) entry into the
              Contest. All entries must be received by the end of each month in
              order to participate in the monthly recurring draw during the
              Contest Period. Sponsor&apos;s designated computer shall be the
              official time keeping device for the Contest. Use of computer
              programs and other automatic means to enter the Contest is
              prohibited and will result in disqualification. Any attempt by any
              entrant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using
              multiple/different email addresses, identities, registrations and
              logins, or any other methods will void such entries and will
              result in disqualification. Normal Internet access, usage charges
              and/or mobile usage imposed by your online service or mobile
              provider may apply. Entries made by any other individual or any
              entity, and/or originating at any other website or email address,
              including but not limited to commercial contest subscription
              notification and/or entering service sites, will be declared
              invalid and disqualified for the Contest. Tampering with the entry
              process or the operation of the Contest, including but not limited
              to the use of any device to automate the entry process, is
              prohibited and any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole
              discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be void. In
              the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account
              holder of the email address associated with the entry in question
              will be deemed to be the entrant, but only if that person meets
              all other eligibility criteria for the Contest. The
              &quot;authorized account holder&quot; is the natural person
              assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online
              service provider or other organization responsible for assigning
              email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted
              address. The potential winner may be required to show proof that
              he or she is the authorized account holder. In the event a dispute
              regarding the identity of the individual who actually submitted an
              entry cannot be resolved to Sponsor&apos;s satisfaction, the
              affected entry will be deemed ineligible. Sponsor, its parents and
              affiliates, and each of their respective owners, officers,
              directors, employees, agents, representatives, vendors, suppliers,
              licensees, successors and assigns (collectively, the &quot;<strong

              entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any of
              the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the
              Contest or by any technical or human error which may occur in the
              processing of the entries in the Contest. The Contest Entities
              assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission,
              interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized
              access to, or alteration of entries. Any communication or
              information transmitted to Sponsor by electronic mail or otherwise
              is and will be treated as non-confidential and nonproprietary.
              Entries become the exclusive property of the Sponsor and will not
              be returned or acknowledged.

              <strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong>
              At the end of the Contest Period, the potential winner will be
              randomly selected in a drawing from all eligible entries received
              throughout the Contest Period. The drawing will be conducted by
              Sponsor or its third party administrator, using randomization
              methods selected by Sponsor or its third party administrator in
              its sole discretion. The drawing will be held at the end of each
              fiscal quarter at 12 p.m. Odds of winning a prize are dependent
              upon the number of eligible entries received during the Contest
              Period. The potential winner will be notified via email and/or
              telephone. Sponsor shall have no liability for any winner
              notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a
              potential winner for any reason. If a potential winner does not
              respond within (2) days of the first notification attempt, or if
              the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or
              undeliverable to such potential winner, such potential winner will
              forfeit his or her prize and an alternate potential winner may be
              selected. Sponsor may successively attempt to contact up to (3)
              potential winner(s) of an applicable prize in accordance with such
              procedure, and if there is still no confirmed potential winner(s)
              of such applicable prize after such attempts have been made, such
              prize may go un-awarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>PRIZES/ODDS:</strong>

              prize notification, including, but not limited to, correctly
              answering the skill-testing question, the potential winner may be
              disqualified and an alternate potential winner may be selected.

              winner&apos;s list without further compensation, unless prohibited
              by law. By submitting an entry, you warrant that all of the

              violate any third party&apos;s legal rights (including without
              limitation rights of privacy and publicity) and otherwise does not
              violate applicable law. Entrants agree that the Contest Entities
              (A) shall not be responsible or liable for, and are hereby
              released from, any and all costs, injuries, losses or damages of
              any kind, including, without limitation, death and bodily injury,
              due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, to participation
              in the Contest or any Contest-related activity, or from
              entrants&apos; acceptance, receipt, possession and/or use or
              misuse of any prize, and (B) have not made any warranty,
              representation or guarantee express or implied, in fact or in law,
              with respect to any prize, including, without limitation, to such
              prize&apos;s quality or fitness for a particular purpose. The
              Contest Entities assume no responsibility for any damage to an
              entrant&apos;s, or any other person's, computer system which is
              occasioned by accessing the Contest Site or otherwise
              participating in the Contest, or for any computer system, phone
              line, hardware, software or program malfunctions, or other errors,
              failures, delayed computer transmissions or network connections
              that are human or technical in nature. Without limiting the
              generality of the foregoing, Sponsor is not responsible for
              incomplete, illegible, misdirected, misprinted, late, lost,
              damaged, stolen, or postage-due submissions or prize
              notifications; or for lost, interrupted, inaccessible or

              technical malfunctions, failures, difficulties or other errors of
              any kind or nature; or for the incorrect or inaccurate capture of
              information, or the failure to capture any information. Sponsor
              has the right in their sole discretion to disqualify any
              individual who is found to be tampering with the entry process or
              the operation of the Contest or the Contest Site, to be acting in
              violation of these Official Rules, or to be acting in an
              un-sportsman-like or disruptive manner, or with the intent to
              disrupt or undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest, or
              to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any other person, and Sponsor
              reserves the right to seek damages and other remedies from any
              such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Sponsor
              reserves the right to modify, extend, suspend, or terminate the
              Contest if it determines, in its sole discretion that the Contest
              is technically impaired or corrupted or that fraud or technical
              problems, failures or malfunctions or other causes beyond
              Sponsor&apos;s control have destroyed or severely undermined or to

              proper play and/or feasibility of the Contest as contemplated
              herein. In the event an insufficient number of eligible entries
              are received and/or Sponsor is prevented from awarding prizes or
              continuing with the Contest as contemplated herein by any event
              beyond their control, including but not limited to fire, flood,

              public health crisis, order of any court or jurisdiction, or other
              cause not reasonably within Sponsor&apos;s control (each a
              &quot;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>&quot; event or occurrence),
              then subject to any governmental approval which may be required,
              Sponsor shall have the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the
              Contest. If the Contest is terminated before the designated end
              date, Sponsor will (if possible) select the potential winner in a
              random drawing from all eligible, non- suspect entries received as
              of the date of the event giving rise to the termination. Inclusion
              in such drawing shall be each entrant&apos;s sole and exclusive
              remedy under such circumstances. Only the type and quantity of
              prizes described in these Official Rules will be awarded. If, for
              any reason, more bona fide winners come forward seeking to claim
              prizes in excess of the number of each type of prize set forth in
              these Official Rules, the winners, or remaining winners, as the
              case may be, of the advertised number of prizes available in the
              prize category in question may be selected in a random drawing
              from among all persons making purportedly valid claims for such
              prize(s). Inclusion in such drawing shall be each entrant&apos;s
              sole and exclusive remedy under such circumstances. These Official
              Rules cannot be modified or amended in any way except in a written
              document issued in accordance with law by duly authorized
              representatives of Sponsor. The invalidity or un-enforceability of
              any provision of these rules shall not affect the validity or
              enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any
              provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable
              or illegal, these rules shall otherwise remain in effect and shall
              be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or
              illegal provision were not contained herein.
