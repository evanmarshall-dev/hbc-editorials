              enter without submitting feedback, please speak to the General
              Manager of the store location. Submission constitutes your
              unconditional acceptance to these Official Rules. Once you have
              submitted your feedback you will receive one (1) entry into the
              Contest. All entries must be received by the end of each month in
              order to participate in the monthly recurring draw during the
              Contest Period. Sponsor&apos;s designated computer shall be the
              official time keeping device for the Contest. Use of computer
              programs and other automatic means to enter the Contest is
              prohibited and will result in disqualification. Any attempt by any
              entrant to obtain more than the stated number of entries by using
              multiple/different email addresses, identities, registrations and
              logins, or any other methods will void such entries and will
              result in disqualification. Normal Internet access, usage charges
              and/or mobile usage imposed by your online service or mobile
              provider may apply. Entries made by any other individual or any
              entity, and/or originating at any other website or email address,
              including but not limited to commercial contest subscription
              notification and/or entering service sites, will be declared
              invalid and disqualified for the Contest. Tampering with the entry
              process or the operation of the Contest, including but not limited
              to the use of any device to automate the entry process, is
              prohibited and any entries deemed by Sponsor, in its sole
              discretion, to have been submitted in this manner will be void. In
              the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account
              holder of the email address associated with the entry in question
              will be deemed to be the entrant, but only if that person meets
              all other eligibility criteria for the Contest. The “authorized
              account holder” is the natural person assigned an email address by
              an Internet access provider, online service provider or other
              organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the
              domain associated with the submitted address. The potential winner
              may be required to show proof that he or she is the authorized
              account holder. In the event a dispute regarding the identity of
              the individual who actually submitted an entry cannot be resolved
              to Sponsor&apos;s satisfaction, the affected entry will be deemed
              ineligible. Sponsor, its parents and affiliates, and each of their
              respective owners, officers, directors, employees, agents,
              representatives, vendors, suppliers, licensees, successors and
              assigns (collectively, the &quot;<strong>Contest Entities</strong
              >&quot;) shall not be responsible for incorrect or inaccurate
              entry information whether caused by Internet users or by any of
              the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the
              Contest or by any technical or human error which may occur in the
              processing of the entries in the Contest. The Contest Entities
              assume no responsibility or liability for any error, omission,
              interruption, deletion, theft or destruction, or unauthorized
              access to, or alteration of entries. Any communication or
              information transmitted to Sponsor by electronic mail or otherwise
              is and will be treated as non-confidential and nonproprietary.
              Entries become the exclusive property of the Sponsor and will not
              be returned or acknowledged.

              <strong>WINNER SELECTION AND NOTIFICATION:</strong>
              At the end of the Contest Period, the potential winner will be
              randomly selected in a drawing from all eligible entries received
              throughout the Contest Period. The drawing will be conducted by
              Sponsor or its third party administrator, using randomization
              methods selected by Sponsor or its third party administrator in
              its sole discretion. The drawing will be held at the end of each
              fiscal quarter at 12 p.m. Odds of winning a prize are dependent
              upon the number of eligible entries received during the Contest
              Period. The potential winner will be notified via email and/or
              telephone. Sponsor shall have no liability for any winner
              notification that is lost, intercepted or not received by a
              potential winner for any reason. If a potential winner does not
              respond within (2) days of the first notification attempt, or if
              the prize or prize notification is returned as unclaimed or
              undeliverable to such potential winner, such potential winner will
              forfeit his or her prize and an alternate potential winner may be
              selected. Sponsor may successively attempt to contact up to (3)
              potential winner(s) of an applicable prize in accordance with such
              procedure, and if there is still no confirmed potential winner(s)
              of such applicable prize after such attempts have been made, such
              prize may go un-awarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>PRIZES/ODDS:</strong>
