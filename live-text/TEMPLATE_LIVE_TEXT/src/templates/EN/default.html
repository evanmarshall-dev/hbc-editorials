              Program in Store or on the Program Website. Once a membership
              application is approved by Hudson's Bay, an account is opened in
              the Member's name &lpar;any such account, whether opened prior to

              4. A valid and unique phone number and email address is required
              to open an Account. Members must advise Hudson's Bay immediately
              of any change to the phone number or email address associated with

              A Member can update any of his/her information on the Program
              Website. Please note that updates are not effected immediately and
              a Member may not be able to redeem any Points until such time the
              update takes effect in Hudson's Bay's systems. No more than one
              person can use a single Hudson's Bay Rewards Account. If a dispute
              arises regarding who owns the email address or phone number
              associated with an Account, and the dispute cannot be resolved by
              the applicable Members, Hudson's Bay may, at its sole discretion,
              require each Member involved in the dispute to provide an
              alternative email address and/or phone number, as applicable.

              supplemental cards&rpar; will only be accessible and redeemable by
              the Member and not by any Supplemental Cardholders. All
              Supplemental Cardholders are permitted to open their own account
              as contemplated in Section 3.
